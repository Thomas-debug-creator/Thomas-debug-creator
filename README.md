### Hi there :call_me_hand:

I am a Master's student in Computational Science and Engineering at EPFL and PoliMi. I mainly specialize in:
- Numerical Analysis :books:
- Machine Learning :computer:
- Deep Learning :brain:
- Image Processing :camera:

I like to apply these skills to a variety of fields such as:
- Rocket Dynamics :rocket: 
- Rock Climbing :climbing:
- Electromagnetics :magnet:
- Computational Fluid Dynamics :droplet:
- Biological Neural Networks :dna:
- Quantum Mechanics :alembic:

Apart from University, I also practice rock climbing, play guitar, and have nerd hobbies like watching movies, playing/making games and reading.
