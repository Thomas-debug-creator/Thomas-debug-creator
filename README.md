### Hello there :call_me_hand:

I am a Mathematical and Computational Science Engineer, graduated from EPFL and PoliMi. I worked at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) on toroidal magnets and at the European Space Agency (ESA) on galactic cosmic rays for JUICE. I currently intern at ELCA Group in Switzerland as a software engineer to build a digital twin of EPFL Xplore's planetary rover.

I like to apply my skills to a variety of fields such as:
- Robots :robot:
- Space Radiation :milky_way:
- Rocket Dynamics :rocket: 
- Rock Climbing :climbing:
- Electromagnetics :magnet:
- Computational Fluid Dynamics :droplet:
- Biological Neural Networks :dna:
- Quantum Mechanics :alembic:

Apart from University, I also practice rock climbing, play guitar, learn about Electronics in Rocket Science, CAD design and I have nerd hobbies like watching movies, playing/making games and reading.
